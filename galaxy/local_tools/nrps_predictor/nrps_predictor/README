This package contains the NRPSPredictor2, a program to 
predict adenylation domain specificity from sequence.

The predictor currently runs on Windows, Linux and on
the Mac OS platform.

To build the NRPSPredictor2 please issue on the shell

ant

and the respective jar will be built and placed in the
build directory.

An exemplary shell script launching NRPSPredictor2 can
be found in the root directory. This script file can be
adjusted if you wish to place some files to different
locations (jars or model files) or use absolute path 
names.


Example usage:

(Linux/Max)

# if you have a multi fasta file with NRPS sequences 
# you issue

sh runNRPSpredictor2.sh -i examples/example.fa -s 0 -r report 

# if you have a file with already extracted signatures 
# you issue

sh runNRPSpredictor2.sh -i examples/examples.sigs -s 1 -r report


(Windows)

# if you have a multi fasta file with NRPS sequences 
# you issue

runNRPSpredictor2.bat -i examples/example.fa -s 0 -r report 

# if you have a file with already extracted signatures 
# you issue

runNRPSpredictor2.bat -i examples/examples.sigs -s 1 -r report
